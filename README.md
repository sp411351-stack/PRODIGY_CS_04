# Simple Keylogger

## 🚀 Task 04 | Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy Infotech

### 🔐 Project Overview
The Simple Keylogger project is designed for educational purposes to understand how keystroke logging works at a fundamental level. The project records keyboard inputs entered by a user and stores them in a log file for analysis. This task focuses on learning potential security threats and emphasizes ethical responsibility, user consent, and legal compliance.

### 🛠️ Key Features
- Captures keyboard inputs
- Logs keystrokes into a file
- Demonstrates basic input monitoring concepts
- Focuses on cybersecurity awareness and defense learning

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program listens for keyboard input events.
2. Each key pressed by the user is recorded.
3. The captured keystrokes are stored securely in a log file.
4. The logged data can be analyzed to understand keystroke patterns.

### 🎯 Objective
- To understand how keylogging techniques function
- To study the risks associated with unauthorized keystroke logging
- To promote ethical practices and defensive cybersecurity awareness

### 🛡️ Ethical Considerations
This project is strictly intended for *educational purposes only*.  
Keyloggers must be used *only with explicit user permission*.  
Unauthorized monitoring of user input is illegal and unethical.

### 🧠 Skills & Concepts Applied
- Cybersecurity threat analysis
- Input monitoring concepts
- File handling
- Ethical hacking principles

### 📂 Files in Repository
- keylogger.py 
- README.md
